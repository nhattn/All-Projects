description:"You called me at three in the morning and before I could speak you said,
"listen, I’m sad and you’re sad and I wanna be with you and I think maybe
we can make each other happy." And I told you that it doesn’t work like
that, because I am the ocean and you’re an anchor, you’ll drown in me and
I think it’d really fucking hurt to have you plunge through my skin and
crash into my bones. When you find me in the bathroom dripping in blood,
you’re going to hate yourself for not being able to fix me and then you’re
going to hate me for making you feel like that.

"You called me at three in the morning and before I could speak you said,

And when you take too many pills because you couldn’t fall asleep and everything
hurt, I’m going to find myself screaming and crying and shaking until you
finally wake up and I’ll be mad at you for scaring me like that and mad
at myself for falling apart again. I love you, but I can’t be with you,
because I’m on fire and I think you are too and we’ll just create something
too big for either of us to put out, and with the scars decorating my arm,
there isn’t any room for burns.

"May be we found love - rigth - where - we - are"

- It hurts. It hurts.
