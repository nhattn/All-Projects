The hardest part of being adult is when nonfiction story is in hand already,
dreams getting apart and I must let go some, but I realize what’s passed
has nothing to do anymore with my time now. Here life becomes narrower but
heavier.

Sometimes I feel undeserving it and ask if I can go back or just dream as
a kid; when seeing ripe fruits on the trees, flying kites, dull traffic
scenes, ripples, or anything that impresses my immature spirit.
