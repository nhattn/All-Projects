description : I feel bad for people who can’t be alone. Who jumps from one relationship to another. Who don’t know how to be single, and see it as a negative quality. Being with yourself teaches, and changes you. You learn to survive on your own, and be satisfied with yourself. Most importantly you realize that you don’t need anyone to be purely happy.

I feel bad for people who can’t be alone. Who jumps from one relationship
to another. Who don’t know how to be single, and see it as a negative quality.
Being with yourself teaches, and changes you. You learn to survive on your
own, and be satisfied with yourself. Most importantly you realize that you
don’t need anyone to be purely happy.
